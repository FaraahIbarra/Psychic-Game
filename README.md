# The Psychic Game
Try to guess the same letter as the computer. You have 9 guesses to begin with, if you guess the same letter as the computer before you get to 0, you win. If you do not guess the same letter before getting to 0, the computer wins. 

## How to Play
All you have to do is type in a single letter until you win or get down to 0 guesses. Once you win or lose the game automatically resets. 

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript. 

## Issues
If the same letter is typed, it counts as a new guess rather than recognizing the guess was already made.
